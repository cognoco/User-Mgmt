# Task ID: 2
# Title: Document and Capture Failure Artifacts from Test Results
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Systematically process the E2E test failure artifacts from the `/test-results` directory. For each unique failed test instance (accounting for retries), extract relevant metadata (test name, browser, error, paths to screenshots/logs within `/test-results`, etc.) and directly populate a comprehensive tracking spreadsheet. This spreadsheet will be the central document for E2E failure analysis and tracking.
# Details:
The `test-results` folder contains a large volume of raw artifacts. The primary goal of this task is to produce a single, structured tracking spreadsheet. When this task is expanded into subtasks, the plan **must** adhere to the following: 1. **Define and Create Spreadsheet Artifact First:** The very first subtask **must** be to define the structure (columns) and create the *empty* tracking spreadsheet. This artifact should be a Markdown table in a new file (e.g., `docs/e2e-failure-tracking.md`). Required columns include (but are not limited to): `Test File`, `Test Name/Description`, `Browser`, `Device Type`, `Timestamp`, `Failure Message`, `Screenshot Path (in test-results)`, `Log Path (in test-results)`, `Video Path (in test-results)`, `Retry Count`, `Initial Analysis Status`, `Identified Root Cause Category`, `Detailed Root Cause Notes`, `Fix Status`, `JIRA/Issue Tracker Link`, `Notes/Observations`. 2. **Iterative Processing and Direct Spreadsheet Population:** Subsequent subtasks **must** focus on iteratively processing the `test-results` directory in fixed-size batches (e.g., 25 failures at a time) to avoid LLM context window limitations. Each processing subtask will involve identifying failures within its assigned batch, extracting the metadata, and directly populating new rows into the *previously created tracking spreadsheet*. Successful tests encountered during processing should be skipped. The paths recorded in the spreadsheet for screenshots, logs, etc., should point to their existing locations within the `test-results` directory. No new organized file repository of artifacts needs to be created. 3. **Batch-by-Batch Analysis and Fixes:** After each batch is processed and documented, analyze and attempt to fix the failures in that batch before proceeding to the next. 4. **Final Review:** The final subtask should be to review the populated spreadsheet for completeness and accuracy.

# Test Strategy:
Verify that the tracking spreadsheet contains accurate and complete information for all failed tests. Confirm that all required metadata is properly extracted and populated in the spreadsheet. Ensure that paths to artifacts within the `/test-results` directory are correctly recorded and accessible.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Define and Create E2E Failure Tracking Spreadsheet [complete]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create the empty tracking spreadsheet as a Markdown table in a new file 'docs/e2e-failure-tracking.md' with all required columns for comprehensive test failure analysis.
### Details:
Create a new Markdown file with a structured table containing all required columns: Test File, Test Name/Description, Browser, Device Type, Timestamp, Failure Message, Screenshot Path, Log Path, Video Path, Retry Count, Initial Analysis Status, Identified Root Cause Category, Detailed Root Cause Notes, Fix Status, JIRA/Issue Tracker Link, and Notes/Observations. Include a brief header explaining the purpose of the document and how it will be used for test failure analysis.

## 2. Process Next Batch of 25 Test Failures [repeat until complete]
### Dependencies: 1
### Description: Analyze the next batch of 25 test failures from the /test-results directory, extract relevant metadata, and populate the tracking spreadsheet. Repeat this subtask as many times as needed until all errors (~300) are processed and documented.
### Details:
For each batch of 25 failed tests, extract test name, browser information, device type, timestamp, error messages, and paths to artifacts (screenshots, logs, videos). Record retry information if applicable. Skip successful test results. Add all extracted information directly to the tracking spreadsheet created in subtask 1, maintaining the established structure. Mark each batch as complete when finished, and continue with the next batch until all failures are processed.

## 3. Analyze and Fix Documented Failures in Current Batch [repeat after each batch]
### Dependencies: 2
### Description: After each batch of 25 failures is processed and documented, review the spreadsheet entries for that batch, analyze root causes, and attempt to fix the issues before moving on to the next batch. Document fixes and update the spreadsheet accordingly.
### Details:
For each batch, systematically review the documented failures, categorize root causes, and attempt to resolve the issues (e.g., by updating code, configuration, or test setup). Record the status of each fix in the spreadsheet, including notes on what was changed or why a fix was deferred. Only proceed to the next batch after completing this analysis and fix attempt for the current batch.

## 4. Review and Validate Completed Tracking Spreadsheet [pending]
### Dependencies: 3
### Description: Perform a comprehensive review of the populated tracking spreadsheet to ensure completeness, accuracy, and consistency of all recorded test failure data.
### Details:
Review the entire tracking spreadsheet to verify that all test failures have been properly documented. Check for missing data, formatting inconsistencies, or potential duplicates. Ensure that artifact paths are correctly recorded and accessible. Validate that the spreadsheet provides sufficient information for effective test failure analysis. Make any necessary corrections or improvements to the spreadsheet structure or content.
