      "details": "The `test-results` folder contains a large volume of raw artifacts. The primary goal of this task is to produce a single, structured tracking spreadsheet. When this task is expanded into subtasks, the plan **must** adhere to the following: 1. **Define and Create Spreadsheet Artifact First:** The very first subtask **must** be to define the structure (columns) and create the *empty* tracking spreadsheet. This artifact should be a Markdown table in a new file (e.g., `docs/e2e-failure-tracking.md`). Required columns include (but are not limited to): `Test File`, `Test Name/Description`, `Browser`, `Device Type`, `Timestamp`, `Failure Message`, `Screenshot Path (in test-results)`, `Log Path (in test-results)`, `Video Path (in test-results)`, `Retry Count`, `Initial Analysis Status`, `Identified Root Cause Category`, `Detailed Root Cause Notes`, `Fix Status`, `JIRA/Issue Tracker Link`, `Notes/Observations`. 2. **Iterative Processing and Direct Spreadsheet Population:** Subsequent subtasks **must** focus on iteratively processing the `test-results` directory in manageable chunks (e.g., by test suite file, or by a limited number of failure directories at a time) to avoid LLM context window limitations. Each processing subtask will involve identifying failures within its assigned chunk, extracting the metadata, and directly populating new rows into the *previously created tracking spreadsheet*. Successful tests encountered during processing should be skipped. The paths recorded in the spreadsheet for screenshots, logs, etc., should point to their existing locations within the `test-results` directory. No new organized file repository of artifacts needs to be created. 3. **Final Review:** The final subtask should be to review the populated spreadsheet for completeness and accuracy.",
