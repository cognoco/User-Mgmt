      "details": "The `test-results` folder contains a large volume of raw artifacts. The primary goal of this task is to produce a single, structured tracking spreadsheet. When this task is expanded into subtasks, the plan **must** adhere to the following: 1. **Define and Create Spreadsheet Artifact First:** The very first subtask **must** be to define the structure (columns) and create the *empty* tracking spreadsheet. This artifact should be a Markdown table in a new file (e.g., `docs/e2e-failure-tracking.md`). Required columns include (but are not limited to): `Test File`, `Test Name/Description`, `Browser`, `Device Type`, `Timestamp`, `Failure Message`, `Screenshot Path (in test-results)`, `Log Path (in test-results)`, `Video Path (in test-results)`, `Retry Count`, `Initial Analysis Status`, `Identified Root Cause Category`, `Detailed Root Cause Notes`, `Fix Status`, `JIRA/Issue Tracker Link`, `Notes/Observations`. 2. **Iterative Processing and Direct Spreadsheet Population:** Subsequent subtasks **must** focus on iteratively processing the `test-results` directory in manageable chunks (e.g., by test suite file, or by a limited number of failure directories at a time) to avoid LLM context window limitations. Each processing subtask will involve identifying failures within its assigned chunk, extracting the metadata, and directly populating new rows into the *previously created tracking spreadsheet*. Successful tests encountered during processing should be skipped. The paths recorded in the spreadsheet for screenshots, logs, etc., should point to their existing locations within the `test-results` directory. No new organized file repository of artifacts needs to be created. 3. **Final Review:** The final subtask should be to review the populated spreadsheet for completeness and accuracy.",
      "testStrategy": "Verify that the tracking spreadsheet contains accurate and complete information for all failed tests. Confirm that all required metadata is properly extracted and populated in the spreadsheet. Ensure that paths to artifacts within the `/test-results` directory are correctly recorded and accessible.",
