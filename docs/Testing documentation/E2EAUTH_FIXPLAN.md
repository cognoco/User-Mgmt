# E2E Auth Tests Fix Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the plan to fix the end-to-end (E2E) authentication tests following the React 19 and Next.js 15 upgrade. These tests are currently failing with connection errors, indicating that proper setup and configuration changes are needed.

## Root Issues

Based on the test failures, we've identified these key issues:

1. **Connection Errors**: Tests are failing with `NS_ERROR_CONNECTION_REFUSED` or `Could not connect to server` errors.
2. **Testing Configuration**: Test configuration may need updates for React 19 and Next.js 15 compatibility.
3. **Test Environment**: The application server must be properly running during test execution.
4. **Lifecycle and Timing Changes**: React 19's changes to component lifecycle and effect timing require test updates.

## Tasks and Subtasks

### 1. Fix E2E Test Environment Setup ⬜

- [ ] **1.1 Create test server startup script**
  - Create a script that starts the Next.js development server specifically for testing
  - Ensure it uses a test-specific port (e.g., 3333 instead of 3000)
  - Add graceful shutdown to clean up after tests

- [ ] **1.2 Update Playwright configuration**
  - Update test port in all test files to match the test server
  - Configure proper waiting behavior for app initialization
  - Set appropriate timeouts for React 19's rendering behavior

- [ ] **1.3 Implement pre-test application state setup**
  - Create fixture data for authenticated/unauthenticated states
  - Set up database seeding for test data
  - Configure proper test isolation between runs

### 2. Update E2E Test Scripts for React 19 Compatibility ⬜

- [ ] **2.1 Fix registration.spec.ts** 
  - Update selectors to match new React 19 component structure
  - Adjust timing expectations for form submissions
  - Fix assertions for React 19 effect behavior

- [ ] **2.2 Fix login.e2e.test.ts**
  - Update form interaction patterns for React 19
  - Fix authentication state verification
  - Update error message assertions

- [ ] **2.3 Fix email-verification.e2e.test.ts**
  - Update email verification flow tests

  - Update form validation assertions

- [ ] **2.5 Fix personal-sso-login.spec.ts**
  - Update SSO provider interaction tests
  - Fix mock implementations for OAuth providers
  - Update success/failure handling assertions

### 3. Implement Robust Test Helpers ⬜

- [ ] **3.1 Create auth test utilities**
  - Implement helper functions for common auth tasks
  - Create authentication state setup/teardown utilities
  - Add user creation/deletion helpers

- [ ] **3.2 Improve test assertion helpers**
  - Create custom assertions for auth-specific states
  - Add helpers for checking notifications/messages
  - Implement form validation state checkers

- [ ] **3.3 Develop E2E specific mocks**
  - Create reliable mocks for external services (email, SSO)
  - Implement interceptors for external API calls
  - Add test-specific environment variables

### 4. Create CI/CD Integration ⬜

- [ ] **4.1 Set up automated test pipeline**
  - Configure GitHub Actions workflow for E2E tests
  - Set up proper environment variables for CI
  - Implement artifact collection for failed tests

- [ ] **4.2 Create test reporting**
  - Set up HTML report generation
  - Configure screenshot and video recording
  - Implement test result aggregation

- [ ] **4.3 Optimize test execution time**
  - Implement parallel test execution
  - Configure proper test grouping
  - Add test retries for flaky tests

### 5. Document Test Update Process ⬜

- [ ] **5.1 Update test documentation**
  - Document new test patterns for React 19
  - Create troubleshooting guide for common issues
  - Document environment setup requirements

- [ ] **5.2 Create developer onboarding guide**
  - Create step-by-step guide for running tests locally
  - Document common test debugging techniques
  - Create examples of proper test patterns

- [ ] **5.3 Update test maintenance documentation**
  - Document procedures for updating tests
  - Create guidelines for test quality
  - Document test coverage requirements

## Implementation Details

### Test Server Configuration

The tests are failing because they're trying to connect to `http://localhost:3000`, but the server is either not running or not accessible. To fix this:

```typescript
// playwright.config.ts
export default defineConfig({
  // Other config...
  webServer: {
    command: 'npm run test:server',
    port: 3333,
    reuseExistingServer: !process.env.CI,
    stdout: 'pipe',
    stderr: 'pipe',
  },
  use: {
    baseURL: 'http://localhost:3333',
  },
});
```

### React 19-Specific Changes

React 19 and Next.js 15 introduce changes that affect testing:

1. **Effect timing**: React 19 has more efficient batching and may change timing assumptions
2. **Event handling**: Events may be handled differently in React 19
3. **Strict Mode**: React 19's Strict Mode may cause tests to behave differently
4. **Component lifecycle**: Component mount/unmount behavior may change

Test updates should account for these changes, particularly regarding timing and effect behavior.

### Common Pattern Updates

Based on the React 19 upgrade, tests should adopt these patterns:

```typescript
// Before
await page.goto('/register');
await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', 'test@example.com');
await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toBeVisible();

// After - with updated timing considerations
await page.goto('/register');
await page.fill('[data-testid="email-input"]', 'test@example.com');
await page.click('button[type="submit"]');
// Add more generous waiting behavior
await expect(page.locator('.success-message')).toBeVisible({ timeout: 5000 });
```

## Success Criteria

The E2E auth tests fix plan will be considered complete when:

1. All E2E auth tests pass consistently in the local development environment
2. Tests pass in CI environment with at least 95% reliability (minimal flakiness)
3. Tests correctly validate all critical auth flows:
   - Registration
   - Login
   - SSO Authentication
   - Password Recovery
   - Email Verification
4. Documentation is updated with the new testing patterns and requirements
5. Developers can easily run and debug tests locally

## Handling Incomplete Feature Tests: Role Management Example

For our role management E2E tests, we've applied the following fix approach:

1. **Port Conflict Resolution:**
   - Located and killed processes using port 3001 with: `netstat -ano | findstr :3001` and `taskkill /PID <pid> /F`
   - This resolves the most common error: `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::3001`

2. **Test Structure Enhancements:**
   - Converted incomplete/failing tests to use `test.fixme()` rather than `test()`
   - This marks the test as intentionally skipped but tracked, making it clear in test reports
   - Example: `test.fixme('Admin can view the Role Management Panel', async () => { /* ... */ });`

3. **Component Implementation:**
   - Created minimal placeholder implementation of the `/admin/roles` page
   - Implemented just enough of the page to validate navigation and basic rendering
   - Deferred testing of advanced functionality until implementation progresses

4. **Documentation:**
   - Added a dedicated section in `TESTING ISSUES-E2E.md` about role management panel testing issues
   - Documented all observed issues and their solutions
   - Provided code examples for common patterns and fixes

5. **Future Test Implementation Plan:**
   - As admin role management features are implemented, progressively convert tests from `test.fixme()` to `test()`
   - Build tests incrementally alongside feature implementation
   - Focus on validating core functionality before edge cases

This approach allows us to maintain test coverage intentions while avoiding CI failures for features not yet fully implemented. It also provides clear documentation for other developers about the expected behavior and implementation status.
