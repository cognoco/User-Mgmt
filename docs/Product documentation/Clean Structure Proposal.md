# Clean Structure Proposal

This document outlines a clean, straightforward structure for the User Management Module that avoids excessive nesting while maintaining good organization.

## Core Principles

1. **Simplicity**: Minimize nesting and complexity
2. **Clarity**: Clear separation between different types of code
3. **Consistency**: Uniform naming and organization
4. **Maintainability**: Easy to understand and navigate

## Proposed Structure

```

│   ├── api/              # API routes

├── tests/                # Tests

## Key Differences from Current Structure

1. **Flatter Organization**: Only 2-3 levels of nesting for most files
2. **Type-Based Structure**: Organized by type first (components, hooks, services), then by domain
3. **Simplified Types**: All types in a single directory with clear file names
4. **Consolidated Utils**: All utilities in a single directory with purpose-based files
5. **Clean Test Structure**: Tests organized by type, mirroring the src structure

## Migration Approach

1. **Start with Types**: Move and consolidate type definitions first
2. **Migrate Components**: Move components to their new locations
3. **Migrate Hooks and Services**: Move business logic next
4. **Update Imports**: Fix import paths throughout the codebase
5. **Migrate Tests**: Reorganize tests to match the new structure

## Benefits

1. **Simplicity**: Easier to understand where files should go
2. **Discoverability**: Clear organization makes files easy to find
3. **Maintainability**: Simpler structure is easier to maintain
4. **Consistency**: Uniform structure across the codebase
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new components, hooks, or services

This structure provides a clean, straightforward organization that avoids excessive nesting while maintaining good separation of concerns. It's easy to understand, navigate, and maintain.
