## Phase 8: Data Management & Platform Support

This phase focuses on providing users with control over their data via export capabilities and ensuring a good experience across different devices.

### 8.1 Personal Data Export (`/api/profile/export`)

**Goal:** A personal user wants to download a copy of their personal data stored by the application, often for compliance reasons (like GDPR's Right to Data Portability).

**User Journey & Expectations:**

1.  **Access:** User navigates to their "Account Settings" -> "Data & Privacy" or similar section.
2.  **Initiation:** User finds a section titled "Export Your Data" or similar.
    *   **Explanation:** Text explains what data will be included in the export (e.g., "Download a copy of your profile information, account settings, and other personal data.").
    *   **Button:** A clear button labeled "Request Data Export" or "Download My Data".
3.  **Action:** User clicks the "Request Data Export" button.
4.  **Processing & Feedback:** Generating the export might take time, especially if the dataset is large.
    *   **Option A (Immediate Download - for small data sets):**
        *   *Feedback:* "Generating your data export..."
        *   Upon completion, the browser automatically initiates a file download.
        *   *File Format:* Typically JSON (machine-readable) or potentially CSV for simpler data structures. Filename like `[AppName]_Personal_Data_Export_[UserID]_[Date].json`.
        *   *Success Message:* "Your data export has been downloaded successfully."
    *   **Option B (Asynchronous Generation - for larger data sets):**
        *   *Feedback:* "Your data export is being generated. This may take a few minutes (or longer). We will notify you via email at [User Email] when it's ready to download." The button might change to "Export Pending".
        *   *Email Notification:* User receives an email: "Your data export is ready". Email contains a secure, time-limited link to download the file.
        *   *Download Link Access:* Clicking the link initiates the file download (JSON/CSV format as above).
        *   *In-App Status (Optional):* The "Data & Privacy" page might show the status: "Export Ready - [Download Link (expires ...)]".
5.  **Error Feedback:**
    *   **Permission Error:** (Shouldn't happen for personal data, but included for completeness) "You do not have permission to export this data."
    *   **Generation Failed:** "Failed to generate your data export due to a server error. Please try requesting it again later."
    *   **Rate Limiting:** "You have requested a data export recently. Please wait [Time Period] before requesting another."
    *   **Download Link Expired/Invalid (Option B):** If clicking an old link: "This download link has expired or is invalid. Please request a new data export."

**Edge Cases (User Perspective):**

*   **Large File Size:** How are very large exports handled? (Asynchronous generation is key). File size limits?
*   **Data Included:** Does the export include everything? (Uploaded files like avatars, or just metadata? This should be clear in the explanation text).
*   **Format Choice:** Ideally JSON for portability, but offering CSV might be useful for less technical users if the data structure allows.
*   **Security:** Download links must be secure, time-limited, and ideally tied to the user's active session if accessed via the app.

### 8.2 Business Data Export (`/api/admin/export`)

**Goal:** A business administrator wants to download a copy of company and team data for backup, migration, or analysis purposes.

**User Journey & Expectations:**

1.  **Access:** Admin navigates to the Admin Console -> "Data Management", "Settings", or "Export" section.
2.  **Initiation:** Admin finds a section for "Export Company Data".
    *   **Explanation:** Text clarifies what data is included (e.g., "Export company profile details, team member list (excluding sensitive personal data like passwords), roles, and potentially activity logs."). Crucially, it should state what is *excluded* for privacy reasons.
    *   **Format Selection (Optional):** Radio buttons or dropdown to select format (e.g., "JSON (Recommended)", "CSV (Team List Only)").
    *   **Button:** A clear button labeled "Request Company Data Export".
3.  **Action:** Admin selects format (if offered) and clicks "Request Company Data Export".
4.  **Processing & Feedback:** Similar to personal export, likely asynchronous due to potentially larger data size.
    *   *Feedback:* "Your company data export is being generated. We will notify you via email at [Admin Email] when it's ready to download."
    *   *Email Notification:* Admin receives an email with a secure, time-limited download link.
    *   *Download Link Access:* Clicking the link initiates the file download (JSON/CSV).
    *   *In-App Status:* Export section might show status and download link when ready.
5.  **Error Feedback:**
    *   **Permission Error:** "You must be an administrator to export company data."
    *   **Generation Failed:** "Failed to generate company data export due to a server error. Please try again later."
    *   **Rate Limiting:** "A company data export was requested recently. Please wait before requesting another."
    *   **Download Link Expired/Invalid:** "This download link has expired or is invalid. Please request a new data export."

**Edge Cases (User Perspective):**

*   **Privacy:** The export *must not* contain sensitive personal data of team members beyond what's necessary and expected (e.g., include email and role, but not password hashes, MFA secrets, or notification preferences).
*   **Data Scope:** Clear definition of what company/team data is included vs. excluded.
*   **Format Limitations:** CSV might only be feasible/useful for tabular data like the team list, while JSON can represent the more complex nested structure of company profile + members + roles.
*   **Concurrent Exports:** If one admin requests an export, should another admin see its status or be able to request another simultaneously?

### 8.3 Responsive Design (Frontend CSS/Layout - User Experience)

**Goal:** Ensure the application is usable and looks good on various screen sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile browsers).

**User Journey & Expectations:**

*   **Access:** User opens the application in different browser window sizes or on different devices (laptop, tablet, phone).
*   **Layout Adaptation:**
    *   **Navigation:** Menus might collapse into a "hamburger" icon on smaller screens.
    *   **Columns:** Multi-column layouts on desktop might reflow into single-column layouts on mobile.
    *   **Text:** Font sizes adjust for readability.
    *   **Images/Media:** Images resize appropriately without breaking layout or becoming too small.
    *   **Tables:** Complex tables might become horizontally scrollable or reflow into card-based views on small screens.
    *   **Buttons/Controls:** Touch targets (buttons, links, form fields) remain large enough to be easily tappable on touch devices.
*   **Functionality:** All core features remain accessible and usable, even if the layout changes.
*   **Performance:** Layout shifts during loading should be minimized. Performance should remain acceptable on less powerful mobile devices.

**Feedback:**

*   The user experience feels seamless and consistent regardless of screen size.
*   No horizontal scrolling required for primary content (except intentional scrolling for elements like wide tables).
*   Text is readable without zooming.

**Edge Cases (User Perspective):**

*   **Very Small Screens:** Test on exceptionally small mobile device widths.
*   **Very Large Screens:** Ensure layout doesn't become excessively wide or sparse on ultra-wide monitors.
*   **Orientation Changes:** Rotating a tablet/phone from portrait to landscape should adjust the layout smoothly.
*   **Complex Components:** Data visualizations, complex forms, or interactive editors might require specific responsive strategies.

### 8.4 Mobile Optimization (Frontend Specifics - User Experience)

**Goal:** Go beyond basic responsiveness to ensure a great experience specifically on mobile browsers, considering touch interaction and performance.

**User Journey & Expectations:**

*   **Touch Interactions:**
    *   No reliance on hover effects for critical information or actions (hover is unreliable on touch).
    *   Sufficient spacing around tappable elements to prevent accidental taps.
    *   Native mobile behaviors are respected where appropriate (e.g., scrolling momentum).
*   **Performance:**
    *   Fast load times over mobile networks.
    *   Minimal use of heavy JavaScript or large assets that drain battery or data.
    *   Smooth scrolling and interactions.
*   **Mobile Browser Features:**
    *   Leverages browser features like numeric keypads for number inputs (`<input type="number">`).
    *   Avoids blocking zooming unless absolutely necessary for a specific component.
*   **Readability:** Content is easily readable in typical mobile viewing conditions.

**Feedback:**

*   The app feels "native" or at least well-adapted to mobile use, not just like a shrunken desktop site.
*   Interactions are intuitive using touch.

**Edge Cases (User Perspective):**

*   **Different Mobile Browsers:** Test on common mobile browsers (Chrome on Android, Safari on iOS).
*   **Network Conditions:** Test behavior on slower or less reliable mobile network connections.
*   **Device Quirks:** Address any specific rendering or interaction quirks on popular mobile devices.

### 8.5 Data Retention Policy (Backend Cron Job/Logic - User Impact)

**Goal:** (Future) Automatically manage the lifecycle of user data, particularly deleting data from inactive accounts or old records according to defined rules.

**User Journey & Expectations (Indirect):**

*   **Policy Transparency:** The application's Privacy Policy document should clearly state:
    *   Under what conditions data might be deleted (e.g., "Accounts inactive for more than [N] years may be deleted.").
    *   What data is deleted vs. anonymized or retained (e.g., for legal/reporting reasons).
    *   Whether users will be notified before deletion due to inactivity.
*   **Inactivity Notifications (If Implemented):** User might receive an email if their account is flagged for deletion due to inactivity: "Your [Application Name] account is scheduled for deletion on [Date] due to inactivity. Log in before this date to keep your account active. [Login Link]"
*   **Account Deletion Experience:** If an account *is* deleted due to policy, attempting to log in would result in an "Invalid email or password" or potentially a specific "Account not found" error.

**Feedback:**

*   Users understand how long their data is kept via the Privacy Policy.
*   Receive fair warning before automated deletion due to inactivity (if this warning mechanism is implemented).

**Edge Cases (User Perspective):**

*   **Defining "Inactive":** Policy needs a clear definition (e.g., last login date).
*   **Paid Accounts:** Active subscriptions typically prevent account deletion due to inactivity, regardless of login frequency. The policy must clarify this.
*   **Legal Holds:** Requirements to preserve certain data for legal reasons might override the standard retention policy.
