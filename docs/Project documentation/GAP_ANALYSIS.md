## 🔴 Critical Current Gaps

### Service Infrastructure Issues
```
Missing Service Factories:
├── /src/services/storage/factory.ts - File storage factory missing
├── /src/services/health/factory.ts - Health monitoring factory missing
└── Database provider imports broken in adapter registry

API Endpoints Missing for Existing Services:
├── Health monitoring (/api/health/*) - Service exists but no routes
├── File storage management (/api/storage/*) - Service exists but no routes
├── Organization CRUD (/api/organizations/[orgId]/*) - Partial implementation
├── Recovery operations (/api/recovery/*) - Service exists but no routes
└── Platform configuration (/api/platform/*) - No endpoints
```

### Database Abstraction Problems
```
Registry Import Issues:
└── /src/adapters/registry.ts:141-142
    ├── DatabaseProvider type not imported
    └── DatabaseConfig type not imported

Services Bypassing Adapter Pattern:
├── /src/services/company-notification/ - Direct Supabase usage
├── /src/services/profile/ - Inconsistent adapter usage
├── /src/services/profile-verification/ - Mixed patterns
└── /src/services/saved-search/ - Direct database calls
```

### Testing Infrastructure Breakdown
```
Critical Testing Issues:
├── Test execution broken due to missing rollup dependencies
├── 18+ core modules without unit tests
├── 54+ API routes without test coverage
├── Security components untested (MFA handler, session tracker)
└── Integration tests missing for service layer interactions

Test Quality Issues:
├── Over-mocking hiding real integration problems
├── Debug code mixed with production tests
├── Circular dependencies in test setup
└── 676 test files but execution fails
```

## 🟡 Medium Priority Gaps

### Validation and Compliance Issues
```
Production TODOs Still Present:
├── /app/api/profile/business/route.ts:109 - "Replace with proper RBAC check"
├── /app/api/profile/business/route.ts:160 - "Add optimistic locking"
└── /app/api/address/validate/route.ts:139 - "Parse suggestions from address API"

Compliance Features Needing Enhancement:
├── Data retention automation
├── GDPR request processing optimization
└── Enhanced audit trail analysis
```

### Performance & Monitoring Gaps
```
Missing Monitoring Infrastructure:
├── System health check endpoints
├── Performance metrics collection
├── Error rate monitoring
├── Database performance tracking
└── Real-time alerting system
```

## 🟢 Enhanced Features for Future Phases

### Advanced Functionality
- Bulk import/export operations for user data
- Advanced search with full-text indexing
- Real-time collaboration features
- Enhanced webhook delivery tracking
- Multi-backend database support (Prisma, GraphQL adapters)

### Enterprise Features
- Advanced security policies and compliance reporting
- Multi-region deployment support
- Advanced caching strategies
- Horizontal scaling optimizations
- Advanced monitoring and alerting dashboards

## 📋 Immediate Action Plan (Next 30 Days)

### Week 1-2: Critical Infrastructure Fixes
```
Priority 1 Tasks:
├── [ ] Fix adapter registry database imports
├── [ ] Create missing service factories (storage, health)
├── [ ] Fix test dependencies to enable test execution
├── [ ] Resolve production TODO comments
└── [ ] Add missing API endpoints for existing services

Success Criteria: All tests pass, no import errors, services have API routes
```

### Week 3-4: Testing & Security
```
Priority 2 Tasks:
├── [ ] Add comprehensive security test suite
├── [ ] Create missing unit tests for core modules
├── [ ] Add API route test coverage
├── [ ] Test error handling scenarios
└── [ ] Remove debug code from production tests

Success Criteria: 80%+ test coverage, security scenarios covered
```

## 📊 Progress Metrics

### Current Status
- **Core Architecture**: ✅ 100% complete (26/26 modules)
- **Service Implementation**: ⚠️ 92% complete (24/26 with factories)
- **API Coverage**: ⚠️ 85% complete (missing health, storage, org CRUD)
- **Test Coverage**: ❌ Broken (dependencies need fixing)
- **Security Testing**: ❌ Critical gaps in security component testing

### Target Metrics (30 days)
- **Service Implementation**: 100% complete with proper factories
- **API Coverage**: 100% of services have corresponding endpoints
- **Test Coverage**: 85% overall, 95% for critical security paths
- **Infrastructure**: Zero critical import/dependency errors
