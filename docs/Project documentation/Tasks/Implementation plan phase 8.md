## Technical Considerations

1. **Backward Compatibility**: Ensure all changes maintain compatibility with existing data structures.
2. **Performance Impact**: Scheduled jobs must be optimized to minimize database load.
3. **Security**: Data export must maintain proper access controls and data minimization.
4. **Error Handling**: All processes must handle failures gracefully with appropriate logging.
5. **Internationalization**: All new UI elements must support the application's supported languages.

## Risk Analysis

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Data export timeouts for large datasets | High | Medium | Implement asynchronous processing with background jobs |
| Mobile performance issues | Medium | Low | Performance testing on low-end devices, code optimization |
| Data retention conflicts with legal requirements | High | Low | Review policies with legal team before implementation |
| Scheduled jobs affecting system performance | Medium | Medium | Run jobs during off-peak hours, optimize queries |
