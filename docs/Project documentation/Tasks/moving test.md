UI Layer Tests
Component tests from components/auth/__tests__/ can be moved to ui/headless/auth/tests/ or ui/styled/auth/tests/ based on their nature
Component tests from components/profile/__tests__/ can be moved to ui/headless/user/tests/ or ui/styled/user/tests/
Component tests from components/team/__tests__/ can be moved to ui/headless/team/tests/ or ui/styled/team/tests/

Migration Strategy
For each test file:

Analyze if it tests a component that has been migrated to the new architecture
If yes, update import paths to match the new architecture
Update mock implementations to use centralized mocks
Ensure tests follow the interface-based testing approach
Fix any broken assertions or setup code
