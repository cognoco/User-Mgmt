# Manual Verification Checklist


This document tracks the manual verification of the User Management System features against the requirements and expected behavior, and correlates it with automated test coverage.

All Gaps are in gap analysis file.

**Instructions:**
1.  Run the application locally (`npm run dev`).
2.  Follow each `Verification Step` below.
3.  Record the `Actual Result` observed in the browser.
4.  Set the `Status` (Pass, Fail, Implemented, Not Implemented, Bug).
5.  Add any relevant details or screenshots to the `Notes / Screenshot` column.
6.  Review the `Existing Automated Tests` and `Missing Automated Tests` columns to identify coverage gaps.
